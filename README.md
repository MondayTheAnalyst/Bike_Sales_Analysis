# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sales Analysis (Tableau Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was one of the first analytical dashboards I created during my early learning phase as a data analyst. It explores a fictional dataset of global bike sales from 2011 to 2016. The project was built to help me understand key Tableau concepts like visual storytelling, filters, KPIs, and interactivity.

The final dashboard provides key insights into:
- Revenue and profit trends
- Top-selling products
- Customer demographics (age group and gender)
- Geographic distribution of sales
- Year-on-year performance
